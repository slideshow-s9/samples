title: The Open Web - What's at Stake 


# The Open Web - What's at Stake

Brendan Eich, Mozilla @ SXSW 2007

(Adapted S9 Version from Original S5 Slide Deck)

# What Does "Open" Mean?

* Unencumbered, Cross-Platform Standards
* Open Source / Free Software Implementations
* No Single-Vendor "Lock-In"
* User Innovation Network Effects
* Distributed Extensibility

# What Is Not "Open"

* Cubic Equation Wars (16th Century Italy)
* Apple iTunes
* Adobe Flash, Adobe Integrated Runtime/AIR (formerly Apollo)
* Microsoft Silverlight (formerly WPF/E - Windows Presentation Foundation/Everywhere)

# "Open" Examples

* The "New English Dictionary" (1857-1884)
* Extreme Sports Gear (Windsurfing, 1978-1998)
* Ajax Libraries (Prototype, Dojo, jQuery, etc.)
* Most of the Public Web, Still (2007)
* The [WHAT Working Group](http://www.whatwg.org)

# User Innovation Networks
        
* Eric von Hippel, MIT
* User-only innovation networks can flourish when:
  1. "Lead Users" have incentive to innovate
  2. Users voluntarily reveal their innovations
  3. Diffusion of innovations is low cost

# Hard Questions

* Will the W3C HTML WG use WHATWG specs?
* Will Microsoft handicap the Web vs. Silverlight?
* Will Adobe open up Flash?
* What's Apple up to?
* Can Mozilla make a difference (again)?

# Mozilla's Position
        
* We want to move the Web forward quickly
  * Offline Web Apps (Firefox 3)
  * 2D and 3D (OpenGL/ES) Canvas tag
  * JavaScript 2 / ECMAScript Edition 4
  * Better text via CSS3 and beyond
* Working with Opera via WHATWG on `<video>`
  * Unencumbered Ogg Theora decoder in all browsers
  * Ogg Vorbis for `<audio>`
  * Other formats possible
  * DHTML player controls
* For all browsers, not just Firefox
